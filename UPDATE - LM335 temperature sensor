Hello Tech Museum of Innovation Members!
(and new Arduino engineers!)

This is the update to the part that we worked with in Light Up Your World.  I had written the code for a TMP36, which would react quite nicely with our array of LEDs.  However, we actually got a LM335 which is just a whole different temperature sensor.  I'll try to post enough information and new code here to make it work on your end.
